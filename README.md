# PDF Question & Answer with Cohere API

This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload a PDF document, perform semantic search using Cohere embeddings, and get answers to questions generated by Cohere’s chat model based on the PDF content.

---

## Features

- Upload a PDF file and split it into manageable text chunks.
- Generate vector embeddings of PDF text chunks using Cohere's embeddings API.
- Index chunks using the Chroma vectorstore for fast semantic similarity search.
- Use Cohere’s chat API to generate answers based solely on the context retrieved from the PDF.
- Interactive web interface with Streamlit.

## Requirements

### Environment Variables

- `COHERE_API_KEY`: Your Cohere API key with access to embeddings and chat endpoints.

  Store this key securely by creating a `.env` file in your project root or setting it in your OS environment variables.

### Models Used

- Embeddings model: `"embed-english-v2.0"`
- Chat model: `"command-xlarge-nightly"`

These models are accessed remotely via Cohere’s API; no local model downloads are needed.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. *(Optional but recommended)* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

On Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install required Python packages:

pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community chromadb cohere pypdf python-dotenv


4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Cohere API key:
   
**Note:** Do **not** commit this file to version control to keep your key secure.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py


2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Upload a PDF file using the file uploader.

4. Wait for the text to be processed and indexed.

5. Enter your question in the input box and click **Get Answer**.

6. The app will perform semantic search over the PDF text and use Cohere chat API to generate an answer based on the context.

## Code Overview

- `app.py` contains the main application logic.
- Uses LangChain with a custom `CohereEmbeddings` class to generate embeddings via Cohere.
- Uses `Chroma` vectorstore to index and search PDF chunks.
- Leverages Cohere’s chat API (`co.chat()`) for answer generation.
- Uses Streamlit for UI.

## Troubleshooting

- If your API key is not found, double-check your `.env` file or environment variable.
- If you hit API limits, review your usage on [Cohere Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.com/usage).
- Ensure your Python packages are up to date to avoid compatibility issues.
- In case of errors related to embedding or chat, check internet connection and API key validity.
